# Yester Tech Clone

This is clone app from [Yester Tech](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-workshop).

I use it as a standard code for learning how to create an end-to-end app.

## What will I in this repo:

- Copy all of these code from [Yester Tech](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-workshop), step by step.
- Try to understand everything
- Do this app again many times so I can fully understand this
